<br>
<li><strong>1914</strong>- Born in Cresco,Iowa</li>

<li><strong>1953</strong>- Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed  of wheat with a high-yielding American breed, creating a strain that responds well to feterlizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
</li>

<li><strong>2009</strong>- Dies at the of 95.</li>
<p>"Borlaug's life and achievement are testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human peace and progress."</p>
